<p>I'm Ivan Medina-Perez, a hands-on problem solver with a background in technical maintenance and a newfound passion for coding. 
    Currently, I work as a Maintenance Technician, where I troubleshoot, repair, and maintain complex systems to keep operations running smoothly. 
    My career has always been about problem-solving and precision, which naturally drew me to programming as a powerful way to expand those skills into the tech world.

    I'm just beginning my coding journey and am eager to connect with others who share this passion. 
    My goal is to build a strong foundation in software development, combining my technical background with new coding skills to open up new career opportunities. 
    If you have resources, advice, or just want to connect, Iâ€™d love to hear from you as I navigate this path toward becoming a developer.</p>
